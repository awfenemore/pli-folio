      <h1>Engaging with local council</h1>
      <p>
        For Smart Seeds 2019, my team and I were tasked with finding ways to
        ensure that council engagement on public interest projects was
        representative and diverse; a problem many councils have struggled with
        for a long time. Our project attracted a lot of positive attention, and
        was funded to proceed through Lightning Lab Govtech 2019, run in
        Wellington by Creative HQ.
      </p>
      <p>
        We sprinted through a 12 week full time innovation accelerator, where we
        developed a process for better engagement, prototyped better user
        interfaces, did copious amounts of user research, and garnered a lot of
        support from our stakeholders in the organisation.

      <h3>User research</h3>
      <p>
        Our user research was both qualitative and quantitative, involving
        empathy based interviews, card sort interviews, journey mapping, and
        affinity and assumption mapping. This was key to us understanding the
        problem and understanding what was necessary to achieve our large goal.

      <h3>Ideation and initial design</h3>
      <p>
        We took a Design Thinking approach to ideation, with How Might We
        exercises and association mapping to ensure we considered a large number
        of ideas for solutions. These solutions were mapped for value back to
        our user research and presented to both our users and stakeholders to
        ensure their efficacy.

      <h3>Protoyping and testing</h3>
      <p>
        We then turned both our engagement process and our primary technological
        tool in to a working prototype to test with users. We used guerilla user
        testing to work with affected users and found people more than willing
        to help our research and even to go further and engage with the council
        in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        We generated great excitement in the organisation through this process,
        and our stakeholders were very happy with our work. I am thankful to all
        involved for the opprtunity, and the project continues in house to this
        day.
